I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under the supervision of Professor [Shiping Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~spliu/). I'd be happy to make friends with you and discuss math together. You can reach me by Email or QQ.

#### Research Interests  
My current research interests center on topics in discrete geometry and discrete analysis. I am particularly drawn to three classes of problems:
1. Discrete curvatures and related algebraic graph theory problems;
2. Discrete partial differential equations;
3. Quasiperiodic and periodic Schrödinger operators on lattices.
